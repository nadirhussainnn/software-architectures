'''Software architectures in Go lang'''

**1. Layered architecture:**
We typically have 3 layeres in this type of distributed information systems
- Presentation layers: Providing interaction mechanism (Console in this case, otherwise user interface or aplication interface)
- Processing layer: Coordinate the application, process commands and implement logic
- Data layer: handle storage of data by using database or file system  (I have skipped this in my implementation)
